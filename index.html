                    <h5>A Heavy peaty aroma assaults your nose as soon as the bottle is opened. Sanaig's distillation
                        team appear to have been at least very heavily inluenced or possibly even trained by the
                        distillers at Laphroig and Lagavulin as they have created a tribute to their standard fayre.
                        Don't get me wronng, it is very well done and presented but it is still a copy or clone.
                        Laphroig and Lagavulin have both built unique identities and followers because they are both
                        over on the more sheltered east coast of Islay's 'Eastern Race.' Kilchomen is the most westerly
                        distillery ever on Islay. Being on the very windy and exposed, Atlantic Ocean facing, west
                        coast of Islay's 'Western Race'. It should reflect this very different enviroment in its taste.

                        <h5>Notes: The second release from Kilchomen, coming just three months after Sanaig.
                            This is far more like a 12 year old Bunnahabain or a 5 year old Bruichladdich.
                            Far less medicinal than the TCP mouthwash flavour in most Laphroig's.
                            This smells like pine cones and kelp. It tastes cool and fresh, smooth to swallow,
                            as it slowly warms you from throat to belly.

                                Multi award winning, including Single Malt Of The Year 2020. What has not
                                already been said about it. Less intense than a highland single malt, with less
                                burn. A typical classy Speyside dram. A little boring and it took 10 years of
                                releases to get it right.

                                    'White Sprit' for tasting etc. Simply Phenominal, Cask Strength at 60.9%.
                                    That is half as strong again compared to a more commercial brand such as Glen
                                    Fiddich. It smells and tastes like breathing and drinking a lost Wordsworth poem,
                                    yet
                                    with no burn at all. Expensive? = Hell Yes! But worth every penny!

                                        the island
                                        of Madeira. The packaging harks back to their first single malt ten years ago.
                                        With the
                                        whiskys distinct Welsh Gold' colour. The matt black box with the sides cut out

                                        supposed to look like a mine shaft. Light and floral with a sweet sherry like
                                        after taste. Those
                                        clever Welsh Wizards have done it again. Best of all it is still under Â£30 a
